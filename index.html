        <h1>ATOMIC HABITS</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <h4>My Story</h4>
        <div id="text-container">
            <p>On the final day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a
                baseball bat. As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands
                and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have
                no memory of the moment of impact.</p>
            <p>The bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose into a
                distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into
                the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling surged throughout my
                head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and
                two shattered eye sockets.
            </p>
            <p>When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to help.
                I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my classmates
                took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of
                blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of
                how seriously I had been injured.
            </p>
            <p>
                My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long walk to
                the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back into school. Random
                hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our time and walked
                slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of questions.
                “What year is it?”
                “1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.
                “Who is the president of the United States?”
                “Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.
                “What is your mom’s name?”
                “Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.
                “Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to
                remember my own mother’s name.

            </p>

            <p>
                That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the rapid
                swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance arrived.
                Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital.
                Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with basic
                functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the day. Then I
                stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me with oxygen,
                they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle the situation and
                ordered a helicopter to fly me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.
            </p>
            <p>I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad across
                the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me
                along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother, who had
                arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into the helicopter beside
                me. I remained unconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held my
                hand during the flight.
            </p>
            <p>While my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went home to
                check on my brother and sister and break the news to them. He choked back
                tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade graduation
                ceremony that night. After passing my siblings off to family and friends, he
                drove to Cincinnati to meet my mother.</p>
            <p>When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly
                twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled me into the
                trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so severe that I
                was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones needed to be
                fixed, but I was in no condition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure 
                my third of the day I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a
                ventilator.</p>
            <p>
                My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier, they had
                entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister was diagnosed with
                leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My brother was just six months old.
                After two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone
                marrow biopsies, my little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy,
                healthy, and cancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents
                found themselves back in the same place with a different child.
            </p>
            <p>While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker to
                comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with them a decade
                earlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
                As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My parents slept
                restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse from fatigue,
                the next they would be wide awake with worry. My mother would tell me later,
                “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”
