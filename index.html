        <h1>ATOMIC HABITS</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div id="text-container">
            <p>On the final day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a
                baseball bat. As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands
                and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have
                no memory of the moment of impact.</p>
            <p>The bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose into a
                distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into
                the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling surged throughout my
                head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and
                two shattered eye sockets.
            </p>
            <p>When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to help.
                I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my classmates
                took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of
                blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of
                how seriously I had been injured.
            </p>
            <p>
                My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long walk to
                the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back into school. Random
                hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our time and walked
                slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of questions.
                “What year is it?”
                “1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.
                “Who is the president of the United States?”
                “Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.
                “What is your mom’s name?”
                “Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.
                “Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to
                remember my own mother’s name.

            </p>

            <p>
                That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the rapid
                swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance arrived.
                Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital.
                Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with basic
                functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the day. Then I
                stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me with oxygen,
                they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle the situation and
                ordered a helicopter to fly me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.
